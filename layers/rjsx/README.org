#+TITLE: rjsx layer

* Description
This layer adds some syntax adapte and other enhance for =js2-mode= (replace =react layer=)

* Features
 - Retention function with =javascript layer= from spacemacs
 - Add [[https://flowtype.org/][flow]] syntax support base on =HairyRabbit/js2-mode=
 - Add flow type checking to flycheck (based on the flycheck-flow package)
 - company-mode completion using company-flow, "compilation" using =flow status= and =flow check=
 - Add support for jump to declaration of a flow type
 - Auto staring =flow server= in a project specific comint buffer
 - Add jsx syntax support base on =rjsx-mode=
 - Add some es6+ syntax support

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =rjsx= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file. Please ensure you already have the flow binary installed and in your PATH.

To prevent the flow server from auto-starting, set =flow-type-no-auto-start= to =t=.

You can always show types manually using =flow-type/show-type-at-cursor=,
bound to =,ft= by default.
