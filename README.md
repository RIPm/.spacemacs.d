# .spacemacs.d
My `.spacemacs.d` directory as a [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)
configuration.

# Installation
1. Install [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/develop) from
  develop branch. Follow the instruction for installation and don't forget to
  install dependencies like fonts.

2. Clone this repository into your home.
  `git clone https://github.com/RIPm/.spacemacs.d.git`

3. Remove `.spacemacs` file inside your home.
  It's a file automatically generated by **Spacemacs**.
  `rm .spacemacs`

4. That's it!

  You are now ready to use **Spacemacs** with my configuration. For the best
  experience, use **Spacemacs** on a graphical version of Emacs!

# Dependencies
- Search tools with "[rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)",
  "[ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)",
  "[pt](https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher)", "ack", or
  "grep". You only need to install one of them. I recommend "rg" the as I'm
  happy with it.

# Configurations
Edit `~/.spacemacs.d/init.el` instead of `~/.spacemacs`.

You can open the configuration file directly via `SPC f e d`.

You can also compare the differences betweeh the default **Spacemacs** settings
versus mine via `SPC f e D`.
